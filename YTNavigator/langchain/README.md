# 🔴 YT Navigator

![YT Navigator Home Page](./images/home.png)

## 📋 Overview

YT Navigator is an AI-powered application that helps you navigate and search through YouTube channel content efficiently. Instead of manually watching hours of videos to find specific information, YT Navigator allows you to:

1. **🔍 Search through a channel's videos** using natural language queries
2. **💬 Chat with a channel's content** to get answers based on video transcripts
3. **⏱️ Discover relevant video segments** with precise timestamps

Perfect for researchers, students, content creators, or anyone who needs to extract information from YouTube channels quickly.

## ✨ Main Features

- **🔐 Authentication**: Secure login and independent sessions
- **📺 Channel Management**: Scan up to 100 videos per channel and get a summary of the channel
- **🔍 Search**: Find relevant video segments using Semantic Search
- **💬 Chat**: Have conversations with an AI that has knowledge of the channel's content

### 1- 📥 Channel data retrieval

![Channel data retrieval](./images/scan.png)
For this part, the user enters a YouTube channel URL which the system validates before extracting the channel username. The system then fetches channel details including title, description, and profile picture, storing them in the database.

After connecting to a channel, the user selects how many videos to scan (up to 100). The system then processes these videos in parallel through two paths:
1. 📊 Video metadata is extracted and saved to a relational database (PostgreSQL)
2. 📝 Video transcripts are extracted, split into segments, converted to vector embeddings, and stored in a vector database (PGVector)

Once both processes are complete, the channel content becomes available for search and chat functionality.

### 2 - 🔍 Querying the channel
![Querying the channel](./images/query.png)

The querying process begins when a user enters a natural language query to search across the channel's content. The system processes this query through both semantic search (using vector embeddings) and keyword search (using BM25) for comprehensive results. These results are combined, enriched with video metadata from the relational database, and deduplicated. A cross-encoder model then reranks the results based on relevance to the query. The system standardizes relevance scores, groups results by video, and returns the most relevant videos along with specific transcript segments. The user interface displays these results with video thumbnails, titles, relevant transcript segments, and direct links to the exact timestamps in the videos where the information appears.

    J --> L[Return top videos and segments]
```

### 3 - 💬 Chat with the channel
![Chat with the channel](./images/chat.png)

The chat interface facilitates interactive conversations with an AI agent knowledgeable about the channel's content, utilizing the ReAct framework. When a user sends a message, the system processes it through a decision-making mechanism to identify the appropriate response type. The message can be addressed in three ways:
1) 🔄 A direct response without tool calls for general inquiries,
2) ⛔ A static response for irrelevant questions,
3) 🛠️ A tool-assisted response that queries the vector database to extract specific information from video transcripts. In the case of tool-assisted responses, the agent engages in a cycle where it employs its tools (semantic search and SQL Select query execution) to gather information before crafting a comprehensive answer.

This process mitigates hallucinations and allows for the use of smaller models in handling complex tasks.

## 📖 Usage

### 1. 📝 Register and Login

Create an account to get started.

### 2. 🔗 Connect a YouTube Channel

On the home page, enter a YouTube channel URL to connect to it. The system will fetch the channel's information.

### 3. 📥 Scan Videos

After connecting a channel, you can scan its videos. Choose how many videos to scan (more videos = more comprehensive results but longer processing time).

### 4. 🔍 Search for Information

Use the search feature to find specific information across all scanned videos. The system will return:
- 🎯 Relevant video segments with timestamps
- 📝 Transcripts of the matching content
- 🔗 Links to watch the videos at the exact timestamps

### 5. 💬 Chat with the Channel

Use the chatbot interface to have a conversation about the channel's content. The AI will respond based on the information in the scanned videos.

## 📊 Benchmarking

The repo includes a headless, reproducible benchmark harness for the chat agent
(and for comparing alternative implementations of it against the same data and
metrics). See [benchmark/README.md](./benchmark/README.md).

```bash
python manage.py benchmark_snapshot dump benchmark/data/snapshot.json.gz  # freeze the dataset
python manage.py benchmark_run benchmark/questions.jsonl -o benchmark/results/langgraph.jsonl
python benchmark/evaluate.py benchmark/results/langgraph.jsonl --questions benchmark/questions.jsonl
```
